# 🚀 Geria Voice Cloning - Deployment Ready!

## 📦 Files Created for Deployment

### Core Deployment Files
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (without large model files)
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Excludes model files and temporary data
- ✅ `setup.sh` - Automated setup script for VMs
- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Container deployment
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-container setup
- ✅ `deploy-gcp.sh` - One-click GCP deployment script

### Documentation
- ✅ `GCP-Instructions.txt` - Complete step-by-step deployment guide
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated with professional documentation

### Key Changes Made
- ✅ Modified `app.py` to handle logo loading gracefully across environments
- ✅ Models will auto-download on first run (no need to include in repo)
- ✅ Optimized for cloud deployment

## 🎯 Quick Deploy Options

### Option 1: Automated GCP Deployment
```bash
chmod +x deploy-gcp.sh
./deploy-gcp.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual GCP Deployment
Follow the detailed instructions in `GCP-Instructions.txt`

### Option 3: Docker Deployment
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## 📂 What to Push to GitHub

Your repository should only include:
```
geria-voice-cloning/
├── app.py                 # Main application
├── requirements.txt       # Dependencies
├── setup.sh              # Setup script
├── deploy-gcp.sh          # Deployment script
├── Dockerfile             # Container config
├── docker-compose.yml     # Multi-container setup
├── GCP-Instructions.txt   # Deployment guide
├── README.md              # Documentation
├── .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
├── geria.png             # Logo (small file, OK to include)
└── samples/              # Sample audio files (optional)
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Push

The `.gitignore` excludes:
- ✅ All model files (*.pth, config.json, vocab.json) - ~2GB saved!
- ✅ Generated audio files (outputs/, split_outputs/)
- ✅ Cache and temporary files
- ✅ Large audio samples

## 🌐 Deployment Process

1. **Push to GitHub**: Only source code, no models
2. **Deploy to GCP**: Models download automatically
3. **First Run**: Takes 5-10 minutes to download models
4. **Subsequent Runs**: Instant startup (models cached)

## 💰 Estimated Costs

### GCP VM (e2-standard-4)
- **24/7 Operation**: ~$100-120/month
- **8 hours/day**: ~$35-40/month
- **Storage (50GB)**: ~$2-4/month

### Optimizations
- Use preemptible instances for development (50% cost savings)
- Auto-shutdown scripts for non-production use
- Google Cloud Run for pay-per-use model

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. ✅ **GitHub repo URL updated** to https://github.com/tonzxz/voice_cloning.git
2. **Test locally** before deploying
3. **Push to GitHub** (models will be auto-excluded)
4. **Run deployment script** or follow manual instructions
5. **Access your app** at the provided IP address

## 🎉 Benefits of This Setup

- ✅ **Lightweight Repository**: No large model files
- ✅ **Fast Deployments**: Models download once, cache forever
- ✅ **Cloud Ready**: Optimized for GCP, Docker, and other platforms
- ✅ **Professional**: Complete documentation and automation
- ✅ **Scalable**: Easy to replicate and scale

Your Geria Voice Cloning application is now ready for professional cloud deployment! 🚀
